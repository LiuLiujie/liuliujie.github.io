# About me

I am a master's student in Computer Science (Software Technology Track) at the University of Twente, The Netherlands. I received my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from Northwestern Polytechnical University, China.

I want to become a server-side developer and HPC researcher. I am passionate about many areas including, but not limited to, general purpose computing on GPUs (GPGPU), mutation testing, cloud native, containerisation, CI/CD, web development, iOS development, and semantic web. I enjoy the process of researching solutions for software projects, breaking down solutions to work package, and finally solving concrete technical problems. Being well-organized always makes me enthusiastic and energetic. I am currently researching on CUDA and mutation testing (for Master's project), large language model (LLM), iOS development (for a naive music player), and server-side development (for a job).

I've been lately spending my leisure time jogging, reading books, making fried chicken and watching the F1 Grand Prix.
