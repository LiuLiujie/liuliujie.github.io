# ThreadPool线程池

```java
/**
 * Creates a new {@code ThreadPoolExecutor} with the given initial
 * parameters.
 *
 * @param corePoolSize the number of threads to keep in the pool, even
 *        if they are idle, unless {@code allowCoreThreadTimeOut} is set
 * @param maximumPoolSize the maximum number of threads to allow in the
 *        pool
 * @param keepAliveTime when the number of threads is greater than
 *        the core, this is the maximum time that excess idle threads
 *        will wait for new tasks before terminating.
 * @param unit the time unit for the {@code keepAliveTime} argument
 * @param workQueue the queue to use for holding tasks before they are
 *        executed.  This queue will hold only the {@code Runnable}
 *        tasks submitted by the {@code execute} method.
 * @param threadFactory the factory to use when the executor
 *        creates a new thread
 * @param handler the handler to use when execution is blocked
 *        because the thread bounds and queue capacities are reached
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if one of the following holds:<br>
 *         {@code corePoolSize < 0}<br>
 *         {@code keepAliveTime < 0}<br>
 *         {@code maximumPoolSize <= 0}<br>
 *         {@code maximumPoolSize < corePoolSize}
 * @throws NullPointerException if {@code workQueue}
 *         or {@code threadFactory} or {@code handler} is null

参数解析

- `corePoolSize` 线程池中线程的数目，即使是这些线程处于空闲状态，除非`@code allowCoreThreadTimeOut`被设置。
- `maximumPoolSize` 线程池中允许的最大线程数目
