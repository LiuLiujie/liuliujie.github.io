# My life

I grew up in a coastal city called Zhuhai. After turning 18, I went to college in Xi'an, Shaanxi, 1800 kilometers away from home. When I was 21, I embarked on another journey, this time heading to the Netherlands, 9000 kilometers away, for my graduate studies. My life is all about being away from home, saying goodbye to my family, friends and classmates, again and again.

However, dashing to one and another destinations is not the meaning of life, and what we enjoy are the time between them, the new friends we met, the nice scene we saw, the novel knowledge we learned.

In this part, I record the sorrows and joys of my life, express my emotions, thoughts and feelings, using my native language.
