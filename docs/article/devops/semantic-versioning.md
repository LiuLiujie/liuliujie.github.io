# Semantic Versioning
The detail of semantic versioning can be found [here](https://semver.org).
In this blog I only highlight some key points.

## Summary
Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:  
- MAJOR version when you make **incompatible** API changes
- MINOR version when you add **functionality** in a **backwards compatible** manner
- PATCH version when you make backwards compatible **bug fixes**
- Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
(e.g. 1.0.0-beta, 2.0.0-rc.1)
