# Help Rich Info Get Richer: Enriching a semi-structured dataset using a Semantic Web approach
This project presented a data integration approach to enrich a semi-structured dataset called ProVerB. ProVerB is a project to explain and classify program verification tools. It offers some URLs linking to external supporting resources for each tool. However, these URLs contain little information, and a user needs to explore them manually to find what they need. Therefore, a data integration project is conducted to supply these tools with additional information by fetching original data from these URLs. The solution is implemented using a Semantic Web approach to preserve the structure of ProVerB and explore possible relationships among incoming data. The new data and their potential relationships are inserted back into ProVerB to help this dataset become richer.
